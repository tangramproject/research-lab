## About this Whitepaper

Tangram is a modern blockchain system that focuses on security, efficiency, and privacy. Instead of traditional mining or basic staking, it uses a clever method to randomly choose which participants get to propose and verify transactions, making the process both fairer and less prone to congestion. Its multi-layered voting process quickly confirms blocks while minimizing the chance of errors or forks. Moreover, Tangram incorporates advanced privacy techniques to hide transaction details and protect user identities, and it includes built-in safeguards to keep the network running smoothly even in tough conditions.

## Please Note: Development Status vs. Whitepaper Vision

The current project state in our master/dev branch does not yet fully reflect the comprehensive vision laid out in this whitepaper. We are in the process of integrating and testing many of these advanced features. The whitepaper represents our long-term roadmap and the direction we are committed to achieving as we continue development.

Stay Tuned: We're gearing up for our testnet launch, where you can experience Tangram's innovation firsthand!
